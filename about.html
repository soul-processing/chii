<h2><a href='index.html'>chii</a> / about</h2>
<br>
<p>
    I draw, I am going to college. I have no social skills, no intellect that does not revolve around my many autistic interests, and no experience in life aside from being upset about the current state of the world and deflecting it by creation. This is a portfolio page for "chii" web3 artist bringing old school otaku &amp; denpa to web3 so it looks less soulless. I started working for web3 because of my hyperfixation on social communities, and my growing interest in how people decide to join them. Think of me as a little Researcher who throws themselves into the volcano and says "huh! time to tell others what it's like!" I hope I can make you proud with my anime girl charm.

    <p>sry if u don't like web3, don't hate da playa hate da game.</p>
